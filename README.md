# Diwali Sales Insights – EDA Project

This project started with a simple goal: to understand how people shop during Diwali and what drives sales. 
I worked with a dataset of over 11,000 transactions and used Python to clean, explore, and visualize the data.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and organized the raw sales data  
- Explored correlations and ran statistical analysis  
- Segmented customers by age, gender, marital status, occupation, and state  
- Created visualizations to highlight patterns and trends  
- Pulled out key insights and translated them into business recommendations

## Key Takeaways
- Married women aged 26–35 from UP, Maharashtra, and Karnataka are the top spenders  
- IT, Healthcare, and Aviation professionals show high purchase activity  
- Food, Clothing, and Electronics are the most popular categories  
- Total revenue analyzed: ₹106M+

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
Notebook created in Google Colab

## Why It Matters
This project shows how data can tell a story. By digging into customer behavior, we can help businesses make smarter decisions—like where to 
focus their marketing or which products to promote during festive seasons.
